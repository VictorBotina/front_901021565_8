- Accent color: Green (#7FA634), analogous to the main button color, providing contrast for primary actions and interactive elements.
- Body font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif font, for body text, which offers a modern, objective, and neutral look.
- Headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif font, is also used for headlines; it is versatile and matches body text well.
- Use consistent and accessible icons from Lucide-react across the application to represent various actions and sections.
- Implement subtle transitions using Framer Motion for smooth user experience in menu dropdowns, theme changes, and section appearances.
